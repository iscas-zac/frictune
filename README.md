# FricTune, the tag linker

The idea is very simple. I collect hyperlinks and write articles, and store them somewhere. But how can I find a helpful one in the archive?

1. Link everything with a tag (tune).

2. Link tags.

3. Find through the link.

4. All with a weight (friction).

## made with rust / sqlx

I'm trying to learn rust, and this is an exercise.

## TODOs

The project is under **lazy** development. A few features are to be added:

- [ ] testcases

- [ ] better error handling style

- [ ] better rust code style (maybe not)
    - [ ] parameter style, (reference instead of move, [] instead of vec)

- [ ] complete CRUD APIs

- [ ] UIs

- [ ] automated workflows (with file folders / websites)

- [ ] async / multi-user features (less probable)
